1. Categorical Features (object data type)
These are non-numeric fields that represent qualitative attributes.

srcip (Source IP Address) – The IP address of the sender.
sport (Source Port) – The port number from which the packet was sent.
dstip (Destination IP Address) – The IP address of the receiver.
dsport (Destination Port) – The port number of the receiver.
proto (Protocol) – The network protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
state (Connection State) – The status of the network connection (e.g., ESTABLISHED, FIN, SYN_SENT).
service – The type of network service (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).
ct_ftp_cmd – Number of FTP commands used in a connection.
attack_cat – The category of the attack (e.g., DoS, Reconnaissance, Normal).
Label / label – The binary label (e.g., 0 for normal, 1 for attack)

2. Numerical Features (float64 data type)
These are continuous or discrete numerical values, mostly related to packet statistics.

2.1. Timing & Duration
dur (Duration) – The duration of the network connection in seconds.
Stime (Start Time) – Timestamp when the connection started.
Ltime (Last Time) – Timestamp when the connection ended.
Sintpkt (Source Inter-Packet Time) – The time interval between packets sent from the source.
Dintpkt (Destination Inter-Packet Time) – The time interval between packets received at the destination.
tcprtt (TCP Round Trip Time) – The time taken for a TCP packet to travel from source to destination and back.
synack (SYN-ACK Delay) – The delay between sending a SYN and receiving a SYN-ACK response.
ackdat (ACK-DATA Delay) – The time delay between sending an ACK and receiving the actual data.


2.2. Packet & Byte Counts
sbytes (Source Bytes) – The number of bytes sent from the source.
dbytes (Destination Bytes) – The number of bytes received at the destination.
smeansz (Source Mean Packet Size) – The average size of packets sent from the source.
dmeansz (Destination Mean Packet Size) – The average size of packets received at the destination.
res_bdy_len (Response Body Length) – The length of the response body in bytes.


2.3. Packet Flow Metrics
Spkts (Source Packets) – The total number of packets sent by the source.
Dpkts (Destination Packets) – The total number of packets received by the destination.
Sload (Source Load) – The data transfer rate from the source in bits per second.
Dload (Destination Load) – The data transfer rate at the destination in bits per second.
Sjit (Source Jitter) – The variation in packet inter-arrival time at the source.
Djit (Destination Jitter) – The variation in packet inter-arrival time at the destination.


2.4. TCP Window & Loss Metrics
swin (Source TCP Window Size) – The advertised window size in TCP communication.
dwin (Destination TCP Window Size) – The advertised TCP window size at the destination.
stcpb (Source TCP Base Sequence Number) – The starting sequence number for TCP connection at the source.
dtcpb (Destination TCP Base Sequence Number) – The starting sequence number for TCP connection at the destination.
sloss (Source Packet Loss) – Number of packets lost by the source.
dloss (Destination Packet Loss) – Number of packets lost at the destination.



2.5. Connection Behavior Metrics
trans_depth (Transaction Depth) – Indicates the depth of a request-response transaction (e.g., for HTTP requests).
is_sm_ips_ports – Whether the source and destination IPs & ports are the same (1: Yes, 0: No).
ct_state_ttl (Count of State-TTL Pairs) – The number of times a particular connection state and TTL (Time-to-Live) combination appears.
ct_flw_http_mthd (Count of HTTP Methods) – Number of HTTP request methods used in the connection (GET, POST, etc.).
is_ftp_login – Whether the connection involves an FTP login attempt.
ct_ftp_cmd (Count of FTP Commands) – The number of FTP commands used.
ct_srv_src (Count of Same Service from Source IP) – Number of times the same service has been requested by the source IP.
ct_srv_dst (Count of Same Service to Destination IP) – Number of times the same service has been requested at the destination.
ct_dst_ltm (Count of Connections to Destination IP in Last Time Window) – Number of connections made to the same destination IP in a short time.
ct_src_ltm (Count of Connections from Source IP in Last Time Window) – Number of connections initiated by the same source IP in a short time.
ct_src_dport_ltm (Count of Source IP & Destination Port in Last Time Window) – How frequently a source-destination port pair occurs.
ct_dst_sport_ltm (Count of Destination IP & Source Port in Last Time Window) – How frequently a destination-source port pair occurs.
ct_dst_src_ltm (Count of Destination & Source IP Pairs in Last Time Window) – Number of connections between a specific source-destination pair.


3. Label Columns
attack_cat (Categorical) – Attack category (e.g., Normal, DoS, Probe, etc.).
Label / label (Numerical) – Typically, a binary classification label:
0 → Normal traffic
1 → Malicious traffic (attack)
